### About...
When I started studying Color Theory, I found the concepts of Color Harmony when trying to give an answer to the question about why some colors look or feel better than others. The harmonic formulas to calculate combinations (like the complimentary color, triad, analogous, etc.) seemed an easy way to get nice color combinations, moreover, I played with the concept of Color Wheel and worked on an algorithm based on vectorial analysis to calculate a color circle, (I'm working on a report for this).

However, and digging down into the studies of colorimetry and the nature of color and light, I created the visualization tools described in the [Color Theory module](https://github.com/vinceynhz/python_code/tree/master/ColorTheory#xml-output-of-colorpy) to analyze graphically how these functions looked like, which properties the color shared, what characteristics make those colors *harmonic*. And interestingly, looking around in [ColourLovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/) I found that the palettes that are most loved or liked, do not necessarily fall under any of these functions, apparently they have no corelation that would make them *harmonious*.

So I got this idea of creating a neural network that given a color palette could analyze in what percentage it falls into any of the harmonic functions. And to accomplish these, I needed to start exercising again in neural networks. These code represent the first steps in this new branch of my research.
